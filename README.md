# Working directory
Contains all work from 2017 for the 1st year end of year report on CC 0pi cross-sections

From July, re-writing the functionality to incorporate any signal and background topologies

That work is contained in the 'headers' and 'source_files' directory

The outputs will live in the 'unfolding_general' directory


The functionality is as follows

# Unfolding_General
Writing the unfolding method with the capability of implementing the procedure for any final state topology

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The classes
## Particle
Class to hold the information on a single particle in an event
    
- PDG code
- True kinetic energy
- True opening angle
- Smeared kinetic energy
- Smeared opening angle
- Smeared visibility
- Smeared reconstructability

## Event
Class to hold the particles in an event
    
- Classify if signal
- Classify if background
- Classify if cut

## Interaction
Class to hold the interactions, be them signal or background
    
- Compare the event classification
- Make plots based on chosen signal and background interactions
- Unfolding response matrix filling

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The functions
## Unfolding
Functions involved in the unfolding process
    
- Fill the response matrix
- Unfold the testing sample
- Slice the 2D distribution
- Fill a line of the signal file (pass the name as an argument)

## Cross section
Functions involved in the cross-section calculation
    
- Calculate the cross-section 
- Slice the cross-section
- Apply errors from RooUnfold and flux
- Separate into initial physical process break-down

## Signal comparison
Functions to compare different qualifications of a single signal definition
    
- Slice different definitions of a single signal sample and slice
- Apply errors from RooUnfold and flux
